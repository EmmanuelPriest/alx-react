## REACT IMMUTABLE
<strong>React Immutable</strong> is not a specific library or feature of React. However, there is a concept called <strong><em>"Immutable.js"</em></strong> that is often used in conjunction with React to manage immutable data structures.
<br>
<strong>Immutable.js</strong> is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that provides persistent immutable data structures. These data structures are designed to be efficient, allow for fast updates, and help optimize performance in React applications.
<br>
When using Immutable.js with React, developers create immutable versions of their data objects, such as state or props, and use Immutable.js methods to update and manipulate the data instead of directly modifying the objects. This approach helps prevent unintended mutations and facilitates efficient rendering and re-rendering of React components.
<br>
Advantages of using Immutable.js in React applications include:<br>
<ol>
<li>Improved performance:<br> Immutable data structures can help optimize performance by enabling efficient change detection. React can compare immutable data references, rather than deeply comparing their contents, to determine if a component needs to be re-rendered.</li>
<br>
<li>Immutability guarantees:<br> Immutable.js enforces immutability by design, making it easier to reason about state changes. It helps prevent bugs caused by accidental mutations, as all modifications return new instances of the data structures instead of modifying the existing ones.</li>
<br>
<li>Time-travel debugging:<br> Immutable data structures can be beneficial when implementing time-travel debugging or undo/redo functionality in React applications. Since each state change creates a new immutable data object, it becomes easier to track and revert to previous states.</li>
</ol>
