## WEBPACK
<strong>Webpack</strong> is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications that allows developers to bundle and optimize their code. Webpack can be used to manage dependencies, loaders, and plugins to process and transform various types of files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, into a single bundle that can be served to the client.

Webpack works by starting with an entry point, usually a JavaScript file, and recursively walking the dependency tree to build a graph of all the modules and their dependencies. Then, it uses loaders to transform the source code of each module and plugins to perform additional optimizations on the resulting bundle.
